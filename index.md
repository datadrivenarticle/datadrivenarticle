This page lists [design patterns for data-driven article](https://datadrivenarticle.github.io/patterns.html) collected to support the design and creative exploration of data-driven articles. We run a dedicated [workshop](https://datadrivenarticle.github.io/workshop.html) to help you applying and discussing design patterns in your work.


## What are Data-driven Articles？

Data-driven journalism or data-driven articles can be considered as journalism’s response to the datafication of society. They have being widely used in seasoned data news columns or personal blogs, also known as “textual narratives” and “magazine style narrative visualizations”. The audience can easily delve into the database and explore personalized stories through fascinating visualization and interactions.

## Why design patterns？

There are many high-level guidelines on data-driven article design, including advice about data collection and cleaning, setting a story, and using visualization and interaction. Despite this, we know little about How to create different types of data-driven articles (daily or survey), What are the essential components of the article, and how to match these components.

Creating a data-driven article is admittedly not straightforward: editors have access to numerous data streams which they can process, clean up or analyze as they see fit; they have to think about whether to build an interesting story; they have a wide range of visual representations at their disposal; and they can structure and present these visualizations in numerous ways, to improve the whole article. According to the existing production mode, editors may need to have various skills such as programming, writing, and design to meet these challenges.

Such a number of choices can be overwhelming, so there is a timely need for guidance about effective data-driven article design: Lessons learned from previous practices, help editors without visual background or designers without writing ideas, designed for interdisciplinary work or nonexpert audiences.

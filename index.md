This page lists [design patterns for data-driven article](https://datadrivenarticle.github.io/patterns.html) collected to support the design and creative exploration of data-driven articles. We run a dedicated [workshop](https://datadrivenarticle.github.io/workshop.html) to help you applying and discussing design patterns in your work.

[Data comics](https://datacomics.github.io) are a way of effectively communicating with data through data visualizations. They are inspired by the visual language of comics. This project adds interactivity to data comics to **support exploration, explanation, and engagement**.

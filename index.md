## What are Data-driven Articles？

Data-driven journalism or data-driven articles can be considered as journalism’s response to the datafication of society. They have being widely used in seasoned data news columns or personal blogs, also known as “textual narratives” and “magazine style narrative visualizations”. The audience can easily delve into the database and explore personalized stories through fascinating visualization and interactions.

## Why design patterns？

There are many high-level guidelines on data-driven article design, including advices about data collection and cleaning, setting a story, and using visualizations and interactions. Apart from these, we know little about how to create different types of data-driven articles (e.g., a daily report or a survey), what are the essential components of data driven articles, and how to deal with these components.

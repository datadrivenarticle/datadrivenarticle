[Data comics](https://datacomics.github.io) are a way of effectively communicating with data through data visualizations. They are inspired by the visual language of comics. This project adds interactivity to data comics to **support exploration, explanation, and engagement**. 

Interactions are specified using a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) specification and which can be rendered using our [online editor](). 

Data-driven article creation pattern include: 
* Article title
* Data source
* Narrative device
* Visualization title
* Visualization caption
* Visualization annotation
* Visualization technique
* and Interaction.


Check our [examples](examples.html), attend our [tutorial](tutorial.html), [get started](getstarted.html) with your own interactive data comic, or check our [documentation](documentation.html) of all available interactive techniques.

If you have questions or suggestions, [get in touch](about.html).
